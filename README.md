# Console Apps

To complete the ElevenFifty Gold badge I had to complete three console apps.  A resteraunt menu app, an insurance claims app, and an app that created employee badges that held access to doors they had access to.

#### Komodo Cafe

This simple menu app allows the user to create items on a menu.  It was created in a list format and allows the user to add food items; they show a description of the item, list out the ingredients, and show the price.  The app gives the user the ability to Add new items, update existing items, search the menu, and delete unwanted menu options.

#### Komodo Claims

This app is a handy insurance claims app.  It allows the user the enter new claims into a queue.  The queue collection utilizes FIFO (first in, first out) so it works like a line.  Claims added are handled in the order in which they are added to the app.  The claims app has the ability to create a new claim; you can enter if the claim is for a Car, Theft, or Home.  It also requires a brief description, the cost of the claim, as well as the dates.  Specifically the date when the incident happened and the date the claim was made.  It gives a 30 day window between the incident and claim date to determine if the claim is Valid.

#### Komodo Badges

The badges app is used to create new employee badges, and set designated doors that the ID number on the badge has access to.  Doors can be added, or taken away.  And a list of all created badges can be viewed.  A dictionary was used to create this app the badge ID number works as the key, and the doors allowed act as the value.  In dictionaries the key and value go hand in hand.

## Installation

In order to take a look at my apps you will need to get a clone, or a zip file of the app.  It can be found above.  I built the apps out of VS community 2019.  If you don't have VS community feel free to click the link and download a free version. [vs Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  The download can take some time, make sure you have a stable power source.
